# 100 Days of SwiftUI

This repository contains all of my projects and exercises completed as part of Paul Hudson's **100 Days of SwiftUI** course.

## Overview
This course covers Swift fundamentals, SwiftUI, app architecture, state management, networking, persistence, and more.  
The goal of this repo is to track my progress and showcase the projects I built while learning iOS development.

## Project Structure
Each project is contained in its own folder, named according to the day or project name:

100-days-of-swiftui/

├── Day-01-Hello-World/

├── Day-02-Guess-the-Flag/

├── Day-03-WeSplit/

├── ...


### Portfolio Highlights
While all projects are included, the following apps have been polished and are **portfolio-ready**:  
- **Cupcake Corner** (Networking & forms)  
- **Moonshot** (JSON/API decoding & navigation)  
- **Bookworm** (CoreData persistence & lists)  
- **Habit Tracker** (UserDefaults & state management)  

## How to Explore
1. Browse the folders to see each project.
2. Open the Xcode project (`.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`) in Xcode.
3. Build and run on simulator or device.

## Notes / Future Improvements
- Some apps are exercises; others will be polished for App Store publication.  
- Additional features, UI improvements, and testing will be added to portfolio apps.
